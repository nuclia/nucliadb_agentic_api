The user wants to perform a catalog search in the Knowledge Box based on a question.

You need to identify the most relevant labels and provide a filter expression to perform the catalog search. The filter expression should be in the format used by NucliaDB.

The nucliadb format for filter expressions is as follows:
- Use "any" to indicate that any of the properties can match (logical OR).
- Use "all" to indicate that all of the listed labels must match (logical AND).
- Use "none" to indicate that the listed labels should not match (logical NOT).

Sequential filters are treated as AND conditions.

For filtering by labels, use the format "/l/{labelset}/{label}".

For filtering by label sets without specifying a label, use the format "/l/{labelset}/".

For filtering by file types, use the media type prefixed by "/icon/".

**Example 1:**
Question: 'Find all documents related to technology and health.'
Available Labels:
{"topic": ["technology", "health", "sports"], "category": ["research", "news", "blog"]}
Answer:
{"filters": {{ example_filter_exp1 }}, "reasoning": "The question is about documents related to technology and health, so we create a filter expresion to match any of the labels technology or health in the topic label set."}

{"topic": ["technology", "health", "sports"], "category": ["research", "news", "blog"]}
Answer:
